Add two numbers represented by linked lists | Set 1
Last Updated: 10-11-2020
Given two numbers represented by two lists, write a function that returns the sum list. The sum list is list
representation of the addition of two input numbers.

Example:

Input:
List1: 5->6->3 // represents number 365
List2: 8->4->2 // represents number 248
Output:
Resultant list: 3->1->6 // represents number 613
Explanation: 365 + 248 = 613
Input:
List1: 7->5->9->4->6 // represents number 64957
List2: 8->4 // represents number 48
Output:
Resultant list: 5->0->0->5->6 // represents number 65005
Explanation: 64957 + 48 = 65005


Approach: Traverse both lists and One by one pick nodes of both lists and add the values.
If the sum is more than 10 then make carry as 1 and reduce sum. If one list has more elements than the other then consider remaining values of this list as 0.

The steps are:

Traverse the two linked lists from start to end
Add the two digits each from respective linked lists.
If one of the list has reached the end then take 0 as its digit.
Continue it until both the lists end.
If the sum of two digits is greater than 9 then set carry as 1 and the current digit as sum % 10
