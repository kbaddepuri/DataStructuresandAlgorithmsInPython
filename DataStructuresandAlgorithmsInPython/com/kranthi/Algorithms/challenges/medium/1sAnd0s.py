generate-binary-permutations-1s-0s-every-point-permutations
enerate all permutations of given length such that every permutation has more or equal 1â€™s than 0â€™s in all
prefixes of the permutation.
Examples:

Input: len = 4
Output: 1111 1110 1101 1100 1011 1010
Note that a permutation like 0101 can not be in output because
there are more 0's from index 0 to 2 in this permutation.

Input: len = 3
Output: 111 110 101

Input: len = 2
Output: 11 10
