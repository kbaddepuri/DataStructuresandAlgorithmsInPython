Minimum Increment / decrement to make array elements equal

Given an array of integers where ï¿¼. In one operation you can either Increment/Decrement any element by 1. The task is to find the minimum operations needed to be performed on the array elements to make all array elements equal.
Examples:


Input : A[] = { 1, 5, 7, 10 }
Output : 11
Increment 1 by 4, 5 by 0.
Decrement 7 by 2, 10 by 5.
New array A = { 5, 5, 5, 5 } with
cost of operations = 4 + 0 + 2 + 5 = 11.

Input : A = { 10, 2, 20 }
Output : 18
